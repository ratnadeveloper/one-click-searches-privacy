# Privacy Policy for Rewards Searches Automator

*Last Updated: June 06, 2025*

## Introduction

Welcome to Rewards Searches Automator ("we", "our", or "extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the highest standards of data protection.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Our extension operates entirely on your device and does not:
- Collect personally identifiable information
- Track your browsing history
- Monitor your search queries beyond automation
- Access or store your Microsoft account credentials
- Transmit any data to external servers

### Information Stored Locally
The following information is stored **locally on your device only** using browser storage APIs:
- **Search Preferences**: Number of desktop and mobile searches, delay settings, and search categories.
- **Configuration Settings**: Your preferences for automation, including scheduling options and background search settings.
- **Search Progress Data**: Basic information about completed searches and total searches.
- **Temporary Search Records**: A list of search queries used within the current 24-hour period (to ensure uniqueness).

This local storage is necessary for the extension to function properly and remember your settings between browser sessions. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible by us or any third parties.

## How We Use Information

We use locally stored information for the following purposes:
- To operate and maintain the extension functionality
- To save your preferences for future sessions
- To generate appropriate search queries based on your selected categories
- To track search progress and completion status
- To schedule automated searches based on your preferences
- To ensure unique searches within a 24-hour period

## Permissions and Their Usage

### Storage Permission
Used solely to save your search settings and preferences locally on your device, and to track which searches have been completed within a 24-hour period.

### Tabs Permission
Required to create and control tabs for performing Bing searches automatically. This permission does not allow access to content from other tabs.

### Scripting Permission
Essential for automating the search process, verifying search completion, and ensuring search results are properly registered. Scripts only run on Bing and Microsoft Rewards domains.

### Alarms Permission
Powers the scheduling feature that lets you automate searches at customized intervals and ensures reliable timing even when the browser is in background mode.

### Notifications Permission
Used only to alert you when your searches are complete or when rewards are ready to be collected. Notifications only appear on your device.

### ActiveTab Permission
Allows the extension to detect when searches have completed successfully by checking for search results on the page. No content is collected or stored.

### Host Permissions
Permissions for Bing and Microsoft Rewards domains are required to interact with these sites to perform searches and verify completion. The extension does not access or store any data from these sites beyond what's necessary for automation.

## Remote Code Usage

If enabled after approval, the extension may load remote code from Google AdSense solely for displaying advertisements within the extension's popup interface. This code:
- Only appears in the extension popup, never injected into websites
- Does not have access to your browsing data
- Follows standard AdSense practices for privacy

## Third-Party Access

### Microsoft/Bing
- This extension interacts with Microsoft Bing to perform searches
- Searches performed through our extension are subject to Microsoft's own Privacy Policy
- We have no control over how Microsoft processes data from searches performed through our extension

### Google AdSense (If Enabled)
- If AdSense integration is approved and enabled, advertisements may appear within the extension popup only
- Standard Google AdSense privacy policies would apply solely to the ad display functionality
- No browsing data is shared with AdSense beyond what's necessary for displaying ads in the popup

### No Other Third Parties
- We do not share your data with any other third parties
- We do not use analytics services that would send your data to third parties

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect any user data, there is no data retention period. Local storage data remains on your device until:
- You uninstall the extension
- You clear your browser data
- The 24-hour period for tracking used search queries expires (after which it automatically resets)

## Your Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:
- Right to know what data we collect (which is none beyond local storage)
- Right to access your stored local data (via browser extension data viewing tools)
- Right to delete your data by uninstalling the extension or clearing browser data
- Right to restrict processing by disabling the extension

## Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information:
- All data is stored locally on your device
- We do not transmit your data to external servers
- The extension operates within the browser's security sandbox
- No logging of your actions or data occurs outside your local device

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date.
